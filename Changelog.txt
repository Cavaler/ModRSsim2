  Implement Function Code 22 Masked Write for Modbus TCP/IP. Made Changing "Clone" always redraw display.

  Added Support for Function Code 7 to output first 8 coils (1-8) similar to most Modicon PLC's.
  Modified the MOD_WRITE_MULTIPLE_COILS function to update 8 times the number of bytes to the screen (BITS).
